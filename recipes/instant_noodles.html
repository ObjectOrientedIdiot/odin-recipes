        <p>These are instant noodles, by the way.  You know, just in case you haven't seen them before.  They're edible, I think.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Your instant noodle of choice</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Microwave</li>
            <li>Access to electricity probably</li>
            <li>Bowl</li>
            <li>Pot</li>
            <li>Working human digits (I think)</li>
            <li>Stove</li>
            <li>Seasoning (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Use your fingers (optional) to put the pot on your stove</li>
            <li>Open pack of instant noodles</li>
            <li>Put the block of hard noodles in the pot</li>
            <li>Add some water to the pot</li>
            <li>Turn up the heat a bit so that you can cook the noodles</li>
            <li>When the noodles are no longer a solid brick, turn off the heat and take them out</li>
            <li>Put the noodles in a bowl and add some seasoning (to the noodles, not the bowl)</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Congrats bro, now you have some seriously scuffed instant noodles.  Remember that they are edible even if your eyes say otherwise.</p>
