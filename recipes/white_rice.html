        <p>This is white rice, just in case you've never seen any before.  They're like noodles, but whiter.. and ricier.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Bag of rice</li>
            <li>A cup, maybe two</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>A functional pot with lid</li>
            <li>Stove (if using pot)</li>
            <li>Brain cells (optional, necessity hotly debated)</li>
            <li>Bowl</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Measure out some rice into the cup</li>
            <li>Make sure the rice does not contain dirt or nuclear weapons (optional)</li>
            <li>Add around twice the rice's volume as water</li>
            <li>Slowly pour in the rice</li>
            <li>Boil pot with lid on</li>
            <li>Take off the lid once the rice looks legit, slowly turn down heat</li>
            <li>Put finished rice in bowl</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That's probably a pretty disgusting bowl of rice you've got there.  Don't worry though, it probably wont kill you.  Nice job!</p>
